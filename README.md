# CPSC-559 Distributed Systems Project
- I got this project from my distributed systems class. This was a solo project.

- You can run this code, but it won't work without a Registry setup on another machine and at least 1 other peer.
- This is a large system and sadly by the time of submission the code will not be 100% running and bug free.
- I will keep working on this as the history is documented by git with time and date so that I can further refactor so that I can show this off to employers


## Registry
- You will need to comment out the try catch block
- Tested on Java 17
- Compile with `javac /*.java` outside the registry folder
- Run with `java registry/Registry`
